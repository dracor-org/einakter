**Database of German-Language One-Act Plays 1745–1850s**

*Ed. by Dîlan Canan Çakir & Frank Fischer (2020–)*

## What Is This?

This database is derived from the working corpus for Dîlan's ongoing
dissertation on one-act plays. The growing collection is also intended to
provide a general quantitative overview of German-language one-act plays between
the mid-18th and mid-19th centuries.

For each play we list metadata and links to other projects, if available
(editions at Google Books, Wikidata identifiers, DraCor). The long-term goal is
to place metadata on one-act plays within the growing knowledge repositories of
the Linked Open Data cloud.

The database was first released in June 2020 and is a work in progress. If you
have questions or additions, drop us a line:

## Criteria

We include plays that …

1. … are clearly marked as one-act plays in the subtitle.
2. … are described elsewhere as one-act plays (on playbills, in journals, in
     research literature; example: Lessing's "Philotas").
3. … are not operas or operettas.
4. … were published between 1745 and the 1850s.

A detailed reasoning for the composition of the corpus will be presented in
Dîlan's dissertation.
