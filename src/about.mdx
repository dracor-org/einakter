**Database of German-Language One-Act Plays 1740s–1850s**

*Ed. by Dîlan Canan Çakir & Frank Fischer (2020–)*

## What Is This?

This database is derived from the working corpus for Dîlan's ongoing
dissertation on one-act plays. The growing collection is also intended to
provide a general quantitative overview of German-language one-act plays between
the mid-18th and mid-19th centuries.

For each play we list metadata and links to other projects, if available
(editions at Google Books, Wikidata identifiers, DraCor). The long-term goal is
to place metadata on one-act plays within the growing knowledge repositories of
the Linked Open Data cloud.

The database was first released in June 2020 and is a work in progress. If you

## Criteria

We include plays that …

1. … are clearly marked as one-act plays in the subtitle.
2. … are described elsewhere as one-act plays (on playbills, in journals, in
     research literature; example: Lessing's [»Philotas«](lessing-philotas)).
3. … are not operas or operettas.
4. … were published between the 1740s and 1850s.

A detailed reasoning for the composition of the corpus will be presented in
Dîlan's dissertation.

## Technical Background

All data is collected in a simple YAML file, which can be downloaded
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dracor-org/einakter/main/data.yaml" download="einakter.yml">here</a>.

We also export a [JSON file](https://einakter.dracor.org/data.json), which is
always based on the current version of the YAML file, but in contrast to the
source file it additionally contains some calculated values (currently the
number of characters per play). The JSON file can be easily accessed from
different environments to conduct statistics. Some examples in R:

```R
library(jsonlite)
einakter <- fromJSON("https://einakter.dracor.org/data.json")
hist(einakter$normalizedYear)
plot(einakter$normalizedYear, einakter$numberOfScenes)
plot(einakter$normalizedYear, einakter$numberOfCharacters)
```

The data model is described <a href="https://github.com/dracor-org/einakter/wiki">here</a>.
